To ensure private communication between parties, hybrid cryptography 
combines the best features of symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques. 
An encrypted symmetric key is created for data transmission and then decrypted 
with the recipient's public key. After receiving the encrypted message, the 
recipient may use their private key to decode the symmetric key and access the 
original message. 
This method eliminates the necessity for a private key exchange 
channel by keeping the private key secret at all times.
Hybrid cryptography is commonly employed in today's communication networks to protect the privacy 
and integrity of sensitive information during online transactions, instant 
messaging, and electronic mail.
Key management is essential to the security of the system because, despite the fact that hybrid cryptography gives excellent 
security assurances, it is subject to assaults if the private key is compromised.
